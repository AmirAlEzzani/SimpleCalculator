# SimpleCalculator
A simple calculator, made following a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBJmRD7kNTk"> tutorial on YouTube</a>. Changed bits of the code to understand what each block did, and looked up in documentation to learn more. Also had to debug because of several errors, helped me learn what mistakes I made and also how to look for the source of the bugs in my code.
